# NFLMC
Dynamical sampling with Langevin Normalization Flow

The demo of NFLMC code (written in python3.5) which allows researchers to run the RING example. The Github may be not available to see the code. We can visit https://nbviewer.jupyter.org and type https://github.com/Emcc81/NFLMC/blob/master/DemoNFLMC.ipynb in the box to see the code and the result.

The code is written in jupyter notebook because it is easy for researcher to debug. 

Requirements:

tensorflow==1.5.0       
tensorflow-gpu==1.2.1       
tensorflow-tensorboard==1.5.1 

Environmentï¼š

Ubuntu

We strongly recommend researchers to use jupyter notebook to debug the code, although we also provide the 'DemoNFLMC.py' file.
