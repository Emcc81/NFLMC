# NFLMC
Dynamical sampling with Langevin Normalization Flow

The demo of NFLMC code (written in python3.5) which allows researcher to run the RING example.

The code is written in jupyter notebook because it is easy for researcher to debug. 

Requirements:

tensorflow==1.5.0       
tensorflow-gpu==1.2.1       
tensorflow-tensorboard==1.5.1 

Environmentï¼š
Ubuntu

We strongly recommend researcher to use jupyter notebook to debug the code, although we also provide the 'DemoNFLMC.py' file.
